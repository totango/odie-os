// Intercepts the Workers' outbound fetch() so the tests never touch a real server.
//
// createTestHarness routes a Worker's outbound fetch() back through the Node process, so patching
// globalThis.fetch is enough -- no interception library needed. Requests to the harness itself
// (localhost) pass through; anything else that isn't matched by a handler throws, so an unmocked
// call fails the test instead of silently reaching the internet.
//
// This file is mechanism only. What a given vendor's endpoints return lives in a handler module, so a
// suite for another gatekeeper is a new handler module rather than a fork of this one.

/**
 * Answers one request, or returns null to decline it and let the next handler try.
 *
 * Handlers may be async. That is load-bearing rather than a convenience: a handler sometimes has to
 * wait for the test to say what to answer with, because the thing that identifies the request only
 * comes into existence once the Worker has started making it.
