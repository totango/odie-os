/**
 * Escrow for credentials a reconnect / ensureResources flow obtained but the Workshop has not yet
 * confirmed came from the account's owner (see `GatekeeperUser.reconnect` in workshop-shared).
 *
 * A reconnect URL is a bearer capability, and gadgets bound to the account read its live credentials
 * straight from the gatekeeper, so a flow that wrote its result live would hand those gadgets a
 * phished victim's tokens with nothing in the way. Instead the flow stages them here and reports
 * `reconnectComplete()`; only `GatekeeperUser.commitReconnect()`, called once the Workshop has
 * verified the completing browser, moves them to the live keys. Nothing else reads this key: staged
 * credentials are unusable until committed, and the next stage overwrites them.
 *
 * Every stage carries a random `stageId`, which the flow passes to `reconnectComplete()` so the
 * Workshop's ticket names the exact credentials whose completion minted it. Two reconnects can
 * overlap — the owner's and one a phished victim finished — and a commit that took "whatever is
 * staged" would let the ticket from the first activate the second's credentials.
