// The programmatic Worktree binding: the RpcTarget behind a worktree's env entry in the agent's
// executeCode sandbox (worktree-binding.d.ts defines the agent-facing contract).
//
// A session is minted per executeCode run by the overseer's binding-loopback dispatch
// (startGatekeeperSession, target type "worktree") and lives exactly as long as the execution:
// every operation resolves against the running turn's state through WorktreeTurnAccess
// (agent.ts), so binding operations and file-tool operations see one consistent worktree, and
// writes and commits buffer into the same step and become durable at the same barrier. The git
// side -- base-tree walks, blob reads, commit writes -- goes through the host's WorkspaceGitCache
// and GitStore, the same plumbing the file tools' lazy reads use.
//
// The env.GIT binding (git-binding.ts) serves this same class for its in-memory worktrees,
// substituting a single object holding the worktree's state for both the turn and the host.
//
// Content rules match the file tools': regular files of either mode are operable (an edited
// executable keeps its bit), symlink/gitlink/directory paths throw their descriptive errors,
// and unreadable *content* (oversized/binary) is distinguished from path-shape errors by
// UnreadableContentError -- writeFile falls back to a whole-file `set` on it, while grep
// reports it as a structured error entry (a "(skipped: ...)" note in the freeform format) and
// diff likewise (a "(cannot diff ...)" note).
