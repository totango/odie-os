// TypeScript API exposed to Gadgets by the Spotify gatekeeper.
//
// Two resource granularities are offered (see getGatekeeperClassFor / getSupportedResources):
//
//   1. Spotify Account (whole-instance, `https://*`) -> `SpotifyAccountSession`.
//      Broad access to the connected account: profile, catalog search, the user's library,
//      playback control (Spotify Connect), and all of the user's playlists.
//
//   2. Spotify Playlist (`https://open.spotify.com/playlist/:playlistId`) -> `SpotifyPlaylist`.
//      Scoped access to a single playlist. Hand this out when a Gadget should only be able to
//      read and edit one playlist, not the whole account.
//
// Capability design: the account session is a directory that mints narrower capabilities
// (`getPlayer()`, `getPlaylist()`, `createPlaylist()`). The per-playlist grant returns the exact
// same `SpotifyPlaylist` interface, so playlist logic is identical whether reached broadly or via
// a fine-grained grant.
//
// NOTE: This API intentionally covers music tracks, albums, artists, and playlists. Podcasts
// (shows/episodes/audiobooks) and Spotify endpoints deprecated for new apps in late 2024
// (audio-features, audio-analysis, recommendations, related artists, 30s previews) are not exposed.
