# Gatekeeper Google

This package provides Google OAuth integration for Gadgets. It serves two purposes:

- **Sign-in:** when `google` is in the deployment's `AUTH_GATEKEEPERS` allowlist, "Continue with
  Google" appears on the login page. Sign-in requests only minimal scopes (`openid`,
  `userinfo.email`, `userinfo.profile`) to read the account's **verified email** (`email_verified`),
  which becomes the user's identity.
  The sign-in grant is transient (discarded right after the email is read).
- **Connections:** when a user connects Google (or signs in and later connects it), the scopes for
  the selected resources (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Drive, Calendar, or BigQuery — see below) are requested
  so gadgets can access those APIs on the user's behalf.

A single Google OAuth client is used for both. Set it up as follows.

## Setting Up Google OAuth Credentials

If you're running this project locally and want to use Google API integrations, you'll need to create your own Google OAuth credentials. This guide walks you through the process step-by-step.

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click the project dropdown at the top of the page (it may say "Select a project" or show an existing project name)
4. Click **New Project** in the top-right of the popup
5. Enter a project name (e.g., "Gadgets Local Dev")
6. Click **Create**
7. Wait for the project to be created, then select it from the project dropdown

### Step 2: Enable Required APIs

You'll need to enable the Google APIs that you want to use. Currently supported: Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Drive, Google Calendar, and BigQuery.

1. In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services** > **Library** (or [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library))
2. Search for "Gmail API"
3. Click on **Gmail API** in the results
4. Click **Enable**
5. Go back to the Library, search for "Google Docs API"
6. Click on **Google Docs API** in the results
7. Click **Enable**
8. Go back to the Library, search for "Google Drive API"
9. Click on **Google Drive API** in the results
10. Click **Enable**
11. Go back to the Library, search for "Google Sheets API"
12. Click on **Google Sheets API** in the results
13. Click **Enable**
14. Go back to the Library, search for "Google Calendar API"
15. Click on **Google Calendar API** in the results
16. Click **Enable**
17. Go back to the Library, search for "BigQuery API"
18. Click on **BigQuery API** in the results
19. Click **Enable**

The Google Drive API powers the Docs and Sheets resource pickers, Drive discovery, and Drive scope checks. Native document or spreadsheet content opened from a Drive binding is read through the Google Docs or Google Sheets API. Direct Google Doc reads and edits still go through the Docs API, and direct spreadsheet reads go through the Sheets API.

### Step 3: Configure the OAuth Consent Screen

Before creating credentials, you must configure how the consent screen appears to users.

1. In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen** (or [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent))
2. Select **External** as the user type (unless you have a Google Workspace organization and want to restrict to internal users only)
3. Click **Create**
4. Fill in the App Information:
   - **App name**: Enter anything (e.g., "Gadgets Local Dev")
   - Details are largely optional / irrelevant here, since this app will run it testing mode.
   - Click **Save and Continue**
5. On the Scopes page, you can just click **Save and Continue** without adding anything. The scopes are specified by the OAuth request itself, not the console configuration. (The console's scope UI is only relevant if you later want to publish your app for Google's verification review.)

The scopes requested depend on what the user is doing. **Sign-in** requests only the identity
scopes (`openid`, `userinfo.email`, `userinfo.profile`). **Connecting** Google for capabilities
requests scopes granularly per resource type, not all at once: connecting a Gmail mailbox asks
only for the Gmail scopes, a Google Doc only for the Docs scopes, and so on (identity is always
included). Across all resource types, the gatekeeper can request:

- `openid`, `userinfo.profile`, and `userinfo.email` to identify the connected account.
- `gmail.modify` for Gmail thread reads, organization, replies, forwards, and sending. This single scope already includes label access and sending.
- `documents` for direct Google Docs reads and edits; `documents.readonly` for native Docs opened from account-wide, folder, or exact-file Drive bindings.
- `drive.metadata.readonly` for the Docs, Sheets, and folder pickers, account-wide Drive discovery, exact-file metadata, folder descendant proofs, and native-file scope checks. Google classifies this as a restricted scope, so every Drive resource here needs restricted-scope verification.
- `spreadsheets` for directly selected spreadsheets, including reviewed updates; `spreadsheets.readonly` for native Sheets opened from account-wide, folder, or exact-file Drive bindings. Drive child sessions expose only read methods.
- Existing shared-drive bindings retain their original grammar and scope boundary; `drive.readonly` grants from those connections remain valid.

Compatibility: persisted `{kind: "sharedDrive", driveId}` capabilities continue to list the named
drive corpus, filter foreign results, and recheck membership before and after native content reads.
The historical `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/:driveId` consent pattern is retained rather
than inferred as a new folder grant. Existing `observedDriveFile:` keys (including pending reads)
are decoded and verified on observer admission. New connections use the folder resource and its
fresh root-to-position ancestry checks; shortcuts never substitute for a folder edge.
- `calendar.calendarlist.readonly` so the resource picker can list calendars.
- `calendar.events` to manage selected calendar and check calendar availability.
- `bigquery` for BigQuery dry-runs and queries. This is intentionally broader than `bigquery.readonly` because dry-runs use `jobs.insert`; the gatekeeper enforces read-only SQL and resource scope checks before running queries.

### Step 4: Test Users

This is important! While your app is in "Testing" mode (which it will be by default), only users you explicitly add here can use OAuth.

1. Click **Add Users**
2. Enter your own Google email address (the one you'll use to test Google API integrations)
3. Click **Add**
4. Click **Save and Continue**
5. Review the summary and click **Back to Dashboard**

### Step 5: Create OAuth Credentials

1. In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** (or [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials))
2. Click **Create Credentials** at the top
3. Select **OAuth client ID**
4. For **Application type**, select **Web application**
5. **Name**: Enter anything (e.g., "Gadgets Local")
6. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, click **Add URI** and enter: `http://localhost:8787/gatekeeper/google/oauth`
7. Click **Create**

A popup will appear with your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Keep this window open or copy these values somewhere safe.

### Step 6: Configure Your Local Environment

Create a `.env` file in this package's directory (`packages/gatekeeper-google/.env`):

```bash
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
```

Replace the values with the credentials from Step 5.

> **Note**: The `.env` file is gitignored and should never be committed.

### Step 7: (Optional) Enable Google sign-in

To offer "Continue with Google" on the login page, add `google` to the deployment's
`AUTH_GATEKEEPERS` allowlist (e.g. in the root `.dev.vars`):

```
AUTH_GATEKEEPERS=cloudflare,google,github
```

Sign-in only needs the identity scopes, which are always available, so no extra Google setup is
required. (While the app is in Testing mode, the signing-in user must still be listed as a Test
User — see Step 4.)

### Step 8: Verify Setup

1. Start the application in dev mode (see instructions in the root README.md).
2. Create or open a gadget.
3. Navigate to the **Connections** tab.
4. Click **+ New Connection**.
5. Choose a Google resource type: Gmail, Google Doc, Google Spreadsheet, Google Drive Account, Google Drive Folder, Google Drive File, Google Calendar, or BigQuery.
6. If prompted, connect a Google account.
7. You should be redirected to Google's consent screen in a new tab.
8. The consent screen acts extra-scary since this is an "unverified" test app.
9. After granting access, the tab closes, and you're back to Gadgets.
10. Use the picker to choose the mailbox scope, document, folder, Drive file, project, dataset, or table to connect. (The Google Drive Account resource covers the whole account, so it has no picker.)
11. Create the connection. Ask the agent what it can do, or ask it to write a gadget using the new binding.

You can also see your connected accounts and add and remove them in the settings (accessed through the account menu in the upper-right).

## Worker Preview OAuth callbacks

Deployments using Worker Preview hostnames can register one stable Google callback and relay the
result to the preview that initiated authorization. Configure the stable Worker and its previews
with the same `OAUTH_STATE_SIGNING_SECRET` and `OAUTH_ALLOW_PREVIEW_REDIRECTS=true`. Set the fixed
redirect only on previews:

```text
OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://gatekeeper-google.example.workers.dev/oauth
```

Register `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` as the authorized redirect URI in Google. The preview sends that fixed
URI to Google and carries its own callback in signed, short-lived OAuth state. The stable Worker
accepts return URLs only on its `<preview>-<worker>.<workers.dev>` hosts and forwards only the OAuth
result and state. Normal deployments should omit these settings and continue using
`${BASE_URL}/oauth` directly.

Deploy the relay-capable stable Worker before enabling the fixed redirect on previews. Wrangler
stores baseline and Preview secrets separately, so provision the same signing value in both places.

## Known limitations

Very large Google Docs can exceed Durable Objects' 2 MB value limit after Markdown conversion,
causing tab listing, content reads, and edits to fail.

## Google Drive read-only bindings

Drive exposes three permanent resource URL forms:

- `https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive` selects everything the connected account can read in Drive. Despite the `my-drive` URL it is not limited to My Drive: any ID the account token resolves is in scope. Listings use `corpora=user`, which Google defines as My Drive items the account created or opened plus items shared directly with it, so a shared drive's contents may be readable by ID without appearing in a listing. Bind a folder or file when this authority is too broad.
- `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/<folderId>` selects one folder or shared-drive root.
- `https://drive.google.com/file/d/<fileId>/view` selects one file by its immutable ID.

The folder picker is one search over `corpora=allDrives`, which spans My Drive, "Shared with me", and every shared drive the account is a member of. It runs on the baseline `drive.metadata.readonly` grant and asks for no broader scope. It returns a single provider page of suggestions, so it is an interactive search rather than an exhaustive enumeration: a known folder or shared-drive root that does not surface can still be connected by supplying its `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/<folderId>` URL, which opens the picker prefilled. Folders whose children the account cannot list are not offered, and a search Google reports as incomplete fails rather than presenting partial results as complete.

A folder URL carrying `?resourcekey=` is not supported: the key is dropped, and the binding then fails with a Drive 404 for anyone whose access to that folder comes from the link rather than from a direct grant. Google requires resource keys only for items shared by link before September 2021, and only for link-access users — an owner or anyone granted access directly is unaffected, even when the URL they paste happens to carry a key. Such a folder needs direct access to connect.

The agent-facing `GoogleDriveReadSession` covers account and exact-file bindings. `GoogleDriveFolderSession` is positioned at the selected root and exposes only its current folder's direct children: `list()`, provider-side structured `search()`, `getEntry()`, native Doc/Sheet opens, and `openFolder()` for one live direct child. Listing and search return disposable RPC cursors; child folders and native content sessions are independently disposable capabilities. There is no built-in recursive folder search, traversal pager, raw Drive `q`, file write, shortcut traversal, arbitrary download/export, or Workers AI extraction.

Every folder operation revalidates the selected root and the root-to-current path. A root carrying a `driveId` uses `corpora=drive`; other folders use `corpora=user`. That drive corpus requires membership of the shared drive, so a folder shared directly with a non-member connects and then fails every listing with `teamDriveMembershipRequired` — such a folder needs drive membership, not just folder access. Listing and search always carry a direct-parent predicate, so indexed content, descriptions, and OCR match only immediate children. `search()` accepts up to 50 `childFolderIds` to search inside named direct child folders instead of the positioned one: each is proved a listable direct child in a single batched check, revalidated on every page, and one request then covers them all, so polling many sibling folders no longer costs a request each. That request names every folder in one query, which is what the cap bounds, and it records every named folder as an observation — so one that later stops being listable fails collaborator admission for the whole set, where opening folders individually keeps each disclosure independent. `openFolder()` appends one validated direct-child edge to a new capability without changing the parent capability.

Account, folder, and exact-file Drive bindings request `drive.metadata.readonly`, `documents.readonly`, and `spreadsheets.readonly`. A broader `drive.readonly` or `drive` grant the account already holds covers those requirements, but is never requested here. Existing metadata-only connections are prompted to expand before native content reads are considered granted.

Drive observations are typed as files or listable folders. A folder operation observes its positioned folder path plus each disclosed direct child, and native reads observe the file independently. Before a collaborator opens the workspace, the gatekeeper requires their own explicit Drive resource consent and rechecks remembered units with fresh batched metadata reads; folder units must still be live listable folders. Hidden rejected candidates are not disclosed or remembered.

A search that exhausts with no match is owner-relative and cannot be verified against a file. That read is audited, withheld from current observers, and permanently closes later sharing only after the positioned folder path is revalidated. Intermediate empty provider pages do not trigger the restriction.

## Troubleshooting

### "redirect_uri_mismatch" error

This means the redirect URI in your OAuth credentials doesn't match what the app is sending. Double-check that you added exactly `http://localhost:8787/gatekeeper/google/oauth` (no trailing slash, http not https) to your OAuth client's Authorized redirect URIs.

### "access_denied" error

Common causes:
- **You're not a test user**: While the app is in Testing mode, only users listed in the OAuth consent screen's Test Users can authenticate. Add your email there.
- **You denied consent**: Try again and click "Allow" on Google's consent screen.

### "invalid_client" error

Your CLIENT_ID or CLIENT_SECRET is incorrect. Double-check the values in your `.env` file match exactly what's shown in the Google Cloud Console.

### OAuth consent screen shows "unverified app" warning

This is normal for apps in Testing mode. Click "Advanced" and then "Go to [app name] (unsafe)" to proceed. This warning only appears for test users during development.

### "This app is blocked" or quota errors

You may have hit rate limits or your project may have issues. Check the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) for any alerts or quota warnings on your project.
