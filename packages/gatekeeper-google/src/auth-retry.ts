// Shared fetch helper for the Google gatekeeper API clients.
//
// Two independent retry concerns compose here:
//
//   1. Auth (401). The access token we send can be stale or invalidated before its recorded expiry
//      — e.g. after a re-consent/re-grant, an explicit revoke-then-reconnect, or a refresh-token
//      rotation. The token is cached in the gatekeeper Durable Object's memory and in KV, so a
//      stale-but-unexpired token would otherwise be served on every request and the 401 could not
//      self-heal. On a 401 we mint a fresh token via `getAccessToken({ forceRefresh: true })` and
//      retry exactly once. This is safe on any HTTP method: a 401 is rejected before the request
//      takes effect, so a write is never applied twice. A 403 is an insufficient-scope error that a
//      fresh token cannot fix, so it is never retried.
//
//   2. Transient failures (429 / 5xx / network timeout). Retried with exponential backoff plus full
//      jitter, honoring `Retry-After` when present, on idempotent GETs only: a 429, a 5xx and a
//      timeout all leave it ambiguous whether the server already applied a write. Retrying writes
//      needs a per-request idempotency key (`X-Goog-Client-Request-Id` on Gmail send, a
//      client-supplied event id on `events.insert`); that is a follow-up, not this change.
//
// Both concerns share a single attempt counter, so the worst case is a predictable `retries + 1`
// requests: `retries` transient attempts plus at most one extra for the one-shot 401 refresh.
