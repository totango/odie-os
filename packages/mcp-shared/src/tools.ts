/**
 * How far an endpoint's self-description is trusted.
 *
 * MCP's own guidance is that a client must treat tool annotations as untrusted unless they come from
 * a trusted server. This type is that distinction, made explicit and decided by the deployment
 * rather than by the server describing itself:
 *
 * vetted   an administrator asserted this endpoint's annotations are reliable; they may drive
 *          auto-approval.
 * byo      a user typed the URL in. `readOnlyHint` still classifies reads; nothing it says can
 *          auto-apply a write.
 *
 * Honouring `readOnlyHint` on `byo` is a knowing departure from treating annotations as wholly
 * untrusted, argued in `classifyTool` below and stated on the connect form the user types the URL
 * into. Every other annotation is inert until a deployment vouches for the endpoint.
 *
 * This governs trust in annotations only. Neither tier can be shared (see `sharing-policy.ts`). It
 * is deployment configuration rather than account state, so read it afresh wherever it is used and
 * withdrawing it takes effect without a reconnect.
