// Inlined rather than depended on, and with three deliberate deviations from upstream: a
// promise-returning API instead of a callback, `execFile` with an argv array for `taskkill` so no
// shell parses an interpolated pid, and a guard on the child-lister producing no pids (see below).
//
// `node:child_process` `kill()` signals one process, which is not enough for anything here that
// spawns through a wrapper: `pnpm exec vp run ...` and `node build-app.mjs --watch` (which itself
// runs `pnpm exec vite build --watch`) both leave the real worker running when only the wrapper is
// signalled.
